They often do not show any mercy or emotions during their deployments, only caring about The Union and The Union only, while obviously caring about their fellow soldiers too.\nJoin us to help restore order in this \"lovely\" desert that we all know about.\n\n--[What We Offer]--\n\n- 3 main branches.\n- 3 divisions with more possible divisions in the future.\n- Cheap, optional uniforms (as cheap as possible).\n- Fun events.",
